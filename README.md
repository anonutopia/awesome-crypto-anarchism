**What is crypto-anarchism?**
 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto-anarchism) - Crypto-anarchism (or crypto-anarchy) is a form of anarchy accomplished through computer technology. Crypto-anarchists employ cryptographic software to evade persecution and harassment while sending and receiving information over computer networks, in an effort to protect their privacy, their political freedom, and their economic freedom.
